Welcome to my blog! I thought I'd start one so that I could post about whichever random topics I'm interested in, as well as different things I'm working on. The writing will be a mix of normal and formal - but leaning more towards the normal side. I might post semi-frequently, or I might not depending on how much time I have! 

My name is Michael, or I sometimes go by michaelchips online. At the time of writing this, it's been two months since I started my cyber security Year in Industry at National Highways in June 2025. I've also completed 3 years of my undergraduate Integrated Masters MSci in Computer Science at Royal Holloway, University of London. When my time at National Highways comes to a close in June 2026, I'll be returning to university to complete the final year of my degree.

My main interests in technology are information security, operating systems, networking and quantum computing. But outside of this, I also enjoy playing & listening to music, cars and aviation!

I'm currently focused on learning as much as I can about many different areas of information security, including identity management, secure business architecture, cryptography, critical infrastructure security and pentesting. I'm also focused on coding my project of [simulating the quantum circuit model](https://github.com/michaelchips/volq-quantum), which is written only using Python and NumPy, although there's a lot going on at the moment and sometimes there isn't much time for this, so development is a bit on and off right now. At the time of writing this, it's on version v0.2.0-alpha.

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a pretty neat open-source static site generator. It takes markdown files that you write and converts them into HTML documents with a nice theme, and the great thing about static websites is that their simplicity means they're very fast to load (like this one!). I'm writing these markdown files using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a really amazing software tool for taking and managing notes that I've been using at university for a couple of years now. 

This website runs a theme called [Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/), which I like a lot for how it looks, and I've made my own custom modifications to it. Finally, this website is hosted for free using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages), and you can actually see the repository with all the files for the website publicly [here](https://github.com/michaelchips/michaelchips.github.io)!

That's all from me for now, but I'll be posting more soon. Remember to take it easy and drink plenty of water! 🙂
